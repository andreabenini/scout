# scout
All terrain six wheeled scout robot (ATWSC). For fun and the sake of doing it.  
Project inspired by rocker-bogie designs mostly popularized by NASA Mars Missions and
developed around 1988 in JPL Labs. Sojourner was the first wheeled vehicle to rove on
a planet other than Earth, rocker-bogie was used due to its reliability.

The rocker-bogie design is unsprung and uses split rather than full-width axles,
allowing the rover to climb over obstacles that are up to twice the wheel's diameter in size
while keeping all six wheels on the ground.  
Systems using springs tend to tip more easily as the loaded side yields.
